Setting up a Null Modem
-----------------------

Windows : com0com

Download one of the two versions below (I recommend using the signed version)

    - `Download official unsigned com0com <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/>`_

       - *there is a readme with directions on how to self-sign the driver*

    - `Download signed com0com 2.2.0 drivers (recommended) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/files/com0com/2.2.2.0/>`_


In windows you need to create a null modem serial port.

the easiest (read cheapest) way to do this is using com0com, however there are many other options out there, simply google "windows null modem software", and you should be able to find many alternatives.




Linux : socat

Install socat with :code:`apt-get install socat`
