Setting up a Null Modem
==================================

Windows : com0com
-----------------

Download one of the two versions below (I recommend using the signed version)

    - `Link Download official unsigned com0com <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/>`_

       - *there is a readme with directions on how to self-sign the driver*

    - `Link Download signed com0com 2.2.0 drivers (recommended) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/files/com0com/2.2.2.0/>`_


In windows you need to create a null modem serial port.

the easiest (read cheapest) way to do this is using com0com, however there are many other options out there, simply google "windows null modem software", and you should be able to find many alternatives.




Linux : socat
-------------

Install socat with :code:`apt-get install socat`
